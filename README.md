üßë‚Äçüíº Job Ad App

An application designed for jobseekers and employers.

- Employers can post job ads and browse applicants' resumes.
- Jobseekers can apply to job ads using their resumes and manage their applications.
- Features include city management, job/company/tag management, resume upload, search, and more.

----------------------------

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools Used

- **Winston** for logging all system events and errors in a structured way.
- **Jest** for writing unit tests across core services (`AuthService`, `UsersService`, `CompaniesService`, `JobAdsService`).
- **Joi** for validating request payloads using a centralized validation middleware.
- **Bcrypt** and **JWT** for secure authentication handling (password hashing and token generation).
- **Multer** along with a custom `uploadMiddleware` to handle file uploads for resumes (Only PDF).
- **Redis** was used for caching test purposes (e.g. for fetching cities list and companies list).
- **Custom Errors & Error Handling**: 
  - Custom error classes to define meaningful errors.
  - A controller wrapper to catch and forward errors.
  - A centralized error middleware to respond with proper error messages.

üßº Data Normalization
- All input data is normalized before being passed to repositories to ensure type consistency and proper formatting.

üêò PostgreSQL & Docker
- To connect to the PostgreSQL database and Redis:
  Run `docker-compose up`
- To initialize tables and relationships inside PostgreSQL (viewable via DataGrip):
  Run `npm run create-tables`
